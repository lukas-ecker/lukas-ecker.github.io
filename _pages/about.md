Welcome to my website! My name is Lukas Ecker. I am a Research Associate at the Johannes Kepler University, working at the Institute of Automatic Control and Control Systems Technologies in Linz. 


What i do
=====
With a PhD in Control Theory and Systems Technology and strong foundations in Mechatronics (BSc and MSc), my research centers on nonlinear system identification, observer design, data-driven control theory, geometric control theory, and port-Hamiltonian systems.


Wissenenstransfer and Kooperationen
=====
I am particularly interested in combining data-driven methods and modern control techniques with cutting-edge approaches from machine learning and artificial intelligence, such as Bayesian methods, Gaussian processes, and neural networks. By integrating these advanced tools, I aim to develop innovative solutions that address complex, real-world challenges.
